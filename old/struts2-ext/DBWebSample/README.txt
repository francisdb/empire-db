In order to run an application with the Empire-Struts2-Extension please notice:

1. This Extension works with the Sysdeo-DevLoader. You can download the Sysdeo-Tomcat-Plugin for Eclipse.
   In the archive you can find another zip-file named DevLoader.zip.
   You have to unzip this file to TOMCAT_HOME/server/classes or you should read the README.txt of the archive.
   
2. This example is developed for Tomcat 5.5. If required the Tomcat libraries in the build path of the project
   have to be replaced by your preferred server runtime.

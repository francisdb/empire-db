==========
Apache Empire-db is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet
to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Getting Started
===============

This component requires a Java 5 JDK (or higher).

For an introduction please look at the sample application DBWebSample which can be found in
\examples\DBWebSample

This sample is configured to run with the Sysdeo-DevLoader. 
You can download the Sysdeo-Tomcat-Plugin for Eclipse from 
	http://www.eclipsetotale.com/tomcatPlugin.html#A3
In the Sysdeo-archive you can find another ZIP-file named DevLoader.zip.
You have to unzip this file to TOMCAT_HOME/server/classes and read the README supplied with it.
   
If you are using Eclipse you can alternatively use the WST-Plugin to run the sample with Tomcat.
